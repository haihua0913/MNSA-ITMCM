# MNSA-ITMCM: Measuring Novelty of Scientific Articles through Integrated Topic Modeling and Cloud Model


## Core Components
1. **Topic Modeling Module**
   - Dynamic topic clustering with HDBSCAN
   - Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) topic selection
   - Interactive topic visualization
   - Topic-modeling.ipynb

2. **Cloud Feature Engine**
   - Backward cloud generator implementation
   - Three-dimensional digital features (Ex, En, He)
   - Fuzzy membership degree calculations
   - get-cloud-3-feature.py

3. **Similarity Analytics**
   - Cloud similarity matrices
   - cloud_similarity.py
